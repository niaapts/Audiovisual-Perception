# Audiovisual-Perception
Based on: Shams, L., Kamitani, Y. & Shimojo, S. What you see is what you hear. Nature 408, 788 (2000).

## **Hypothesis:**
Visual ilusion induced by sound - auditory information can qualitatively alter the perception of an unambiguous visual stimulus to create a striking visual illusion. 
 

## **Experiment**
#### **Part 1:**  perception of a single visual flash when accompanied by multiple auditory beeps
*Stimuli:* Flashing a uniform white disk (subtending 2 degrees at 5 degrees eccentricity) for a variable number of times (50 milliseconds apart) on a black background. Flashes were accompanied by a variable number of beeps, each spaced 57 milliseconds apart.

*Result:* Observers consistently and incorrectly reported seeing multiple flashes whenever a single flash was accompanied by more than one beep.

I will add code later for the website
