# Audiovisual-Perception
From paper: Shams, L., Kamitani, Y. & Shimojo, S. What you see is what you hear. Nature 408, 788 (2000).

## **Hypothesis:**
Visual illusion is induced by sound: when a single visual flash is accompanied by multiple auditory beeps, the single flash is incorrectly perceived as multiple flashes.

## **Experiment**
#### **Part 1:**
*Stimuli:* Flashing a uniform white disk (subtending 2 degrees at 5 degrees eccentricity) for a variable number of times (50 milliseconds apart) on a black background. Flashes were accompanied by a variable number of beeps, each spaced 57 milliseconds apart.

##### **Part 2:** investigated the temporal properties of this illusion by varying the relative timing of visual and auditory stimuli. 
*Stimuli:* Increasing time between flash and sound from initial 50 msc to 60, then 70, then 90, then 110.

*Result:* The illusory flashing effect declined from 70 milliseconds separation onwards. However, illusory flashing occurred as long as the beep and flash were within approximately 100 milliseconds of each other, which is consistent with the integration time of polysensory neurons in the brain

#### **Part 3:** checking whether sound has a fusing effect when multiple flashes were accompanied by a single beep. 
*Stimuli:* a single flash was accompanied by two beeps, or two flashes by one or no beeps

*Results:* the illusory double flash is perceptually equivalent to the physical double flash. Observers performance was the same, irrespective of this change in the stimuli.
